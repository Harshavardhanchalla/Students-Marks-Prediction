Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the marks a student can achieve based on the number of study hours. This project uses various data science libraries and tools to preprocess the data, train the model, and deploy a web application for user interaction.

Dataset
The dataset consists of student study hours and corresponding marks. It includes the following features:

Hours: Number of hours studied per day
Marks: Marks obtained
The dataset is stored in the data folder.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/students-marks-prediction.git
cd students-marks-prediction
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preprocessing and Model Training:

Run the train_model.py script to preprocess the data and train the model.
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Running the Web Application:

Use Streamlit to launch the web application.
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Predicting Marks:

Input the number of study hours in the web application to get the predicted marks.
Technologies Used
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For model building and evaluation.
Joblib: For saving and loading the trained model.
Streamlit: For deploying the web application.
Model Training
The model is trained using a linear regression algorithm provided by Scikit-learn. The training process includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Training the linear regression model
Evaluating the model performance
Web Application
The web application is built using Streamlit, allowing users to input the number of study hours and get the predicted marks. The app is interactive and easy to use, providing a seamless experience for users.

Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²) score. The results indicate that the model can effectively predict students' marks based on their study hours.
